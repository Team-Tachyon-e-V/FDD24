\section{Propulsion}

\subsection{Overview}

To accelerate our Hyperloopod we use our EMRAX 188 electric motor from last season. This delivers an output of 60 kW under high voltage and a maximum torque of 100 Nm. This torque gets transferred to a right-angle gearbox and from there is slid to the drive wheels via cardan joints.

\subsubsection{Concept}
The main goal of this system is to accelerate our pod with an acceleration of \(5 \, \text{m/s}^2\). Since the given \(100 \, \text{Nm}\) are not sufficient under an estimated total weight of \(250 \, \text{kg}\), the drivetrain requires a gear ratio. Since an angular gearbox is installed anyway, it is easy to implement this criterion there. In order to maintain a relatively high top speed of the pod, this transmission ratio should be as close as possible. According to the formula
\[
T_{\text{required}} = \frac{{(m \cdot a + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho_{\text{air}} \cdot C_w \cdot A_{\text{Aeroshell}} \cdot v^2 + m \cdot g \cdot \cos(\Theta)) \cdot r}}{{\eta}}
\]
we know that we require at least around \(170 \, \text{Nm}\) of torque to achieve this amount of acceleration. While the pod weight of \(250 \, \text{kg}\) is only an estimate at the time of system design and we are always keen to get such complex parts from our partners, we opted for a \(2:1\) ratio of a Mädler gearbox. With this gear ratio, a respectable top speed of \(113 \, \text{km/h}\) is still possible. This is absolutely sufficient for our prototype, as we are still sticking to our basic idea: For low speeds and accelerations, we drive our hyperloop pod with a conventional wheel drive and for everything above that, the pod will hover with a linear induction motor which will be added in future prototypes. We believe that we can achieve an increase in efficiency in this way as permanent levitation is not necessary.

The transmitted torque must now be directed to the drive wheels in such a way that it is still possible to ensure a working suspension. For this, we use universal joints on both sides of the centered bevel gear. These also come from our partner Mädler and are connected to the bevel gear using in-house produced adapter shafts and feather keys. To finally connect the other ends of the shaft joints to the wheel, only one last shaft is missing. This is also fitted with a keyway on the joint side and a bolt circle on a flange on the wheel side. Now that the wheels are supplied with power, it is important to create sufficient rolling friction. To achieve this, Continental provides us with a rubber coating for our wheels. \\
Of course, this all has to be mounted into the chassis. For this, we use three different types of brackets beside the knuckles, where the wheelshafts are mounted: one for the motor, one for the motorshaft and two of the same kind, which carry everything between the shaft joints.

\subsection{Design Process and Appearance}

\subsubsection{Motor}

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

As previously mentioned, we are once again using our EMARX 188 electric motor from last season. You can find all the technical details in Table~\ref{tab: Motor Specifications} .



\subsubsection{Motorshaft}

\end{figure}



Even though it is a heavy material, C45 steel provides adequate tensile strength to transmit torque from the motor to the gearbox or from the gearbox to the wheels. To maintain a relatively low weight for this part, it is hollow like all the other shafts. In Figure \ref{fig:motorshaft_forces}, you can now see the applied forces. The shaft is mounted on the motor at the screw holes of the flange (green). This means that the motor torque of \(100 \, \text{Nm}\) (pink) acts up to the surface on which the bevel gear is pressed. The calculation of the contact pressure of \(16.26 \, \text{MPa}\) is given by
\[
p_{\text{contact}}=\frac{2\cdot M\cdot S_r}{\pi \cdot D^2 \cdot l\cdot \mu}
\]
In addition, there is a centrifugal force (blue) at maximum rotational speed of \(6000 \, \text{rpm}\).

\autoref{fig:motorshaft_forces}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{picture_forces_motorshaft}
\caption{Forces acting on the Motorshaft}
\label{fig:motorshaft_forces}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Bevel Gears}
picture gearbox

The bevel gears with the article numbers 36736000 and 36736100 are our choice to fulfill the desired purpose.
36736000 offers spur gearing with 20 teeth. With a maximum permissible torque of 130 Nm, it can withstand the prevailing forces. 
The larger counterpart 36736100 therefore has twice as many teeth (40 teeth) and is designed for a maximum torque of 260 Nm.

\subsubsection{Gearshafts}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{picture_gearshafts}
\caption{}
\label{}
\end{figure}

To be able to conduct the torque of the bevel gear, we have designed another shaft. This consists of two individual parts, one which is again pressed into the bevel gear and the other which is screwed onto the first part after pressing.
The specifications of the initially acting shaft are as follows:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{picture_gearshaft_right}
\caption{}
\label{}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{spaceholder_technical_drawing}
\caption{}
\label{}
\end{figure}

Fig.xx  shows all the acting forces. For calculating the pressing force (red) we again use the formula for \(p_{\text{contact}}\)
and get the result of \(21.22 \, \text{MPa}\). The higher torque of \(200 \, \text{Nm}\) (pink) resulting from the gear ratio also acts on this surface and is transferred to the screw holes and keyway (green). A centrifugal force (blue) also acts on this part, but this has now been halved by the gear ratio and is therefore only based on \(3000 \, \text{rpm}\). Finally, we assume a bearing restraint (orange) at the shaft end to the shaft joint. The admissibility of this case is described in the paragraph on the shaft joint itself.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{picture_forces_gearshaft_right}
\caption{Forces acting on the pressfitted Gearshaft}
\label{fig:gearshaft_right_forces}
\end{figure}


The torque is now transferred to the second part of the gearshaft:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{picture_gearshaft_left}
\caption{}
\label{}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{spaceholder_technical_drawing}
\caption{}
\label{}
\end{figure}

Fig.xx shows all the forces acting on this part. The two shafts are connected to each other at the screw holes (green). The centrifugal force (blue) acts as in the first shaft at \(3000 \, \text{rpm}\) and the torque of \(200 \, \text{Nm}\) (pink) up to the keyway. This end piece of the shaft is also simulated as a bearing (orange).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{picture_forces_gearshaft_left}
\caption{Forces acting on the bolted Gearshaft}
\label{fig:gearshaft_left_forces}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Shaft Joints}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{picture_shaft_joint}
\caption{}
\label{}
\end{figure}


To enable the system to absorb shocks, we use cardan shafts on each side. This allows the wheels to move vertically independently of the rest of the pod. Our partner Mädler is once again supplying us with such complex parts. Item number 63167000N is a double universal joint which we install in our system. It has a keyway at both ends and is designed to transmit 202 Nm at 3000 rpm. These specifications are almost perfect for our drive power.
We will mount the heart of our system at the ends of this joint adjacent to the gearbox. This is also the reason why a bearing is created at the respective ends in the simulations of the shafts because this bearing is also attached above the respective area.
However, more on the bearing and attachment points will follow in the corresponding sections.

\subsubsection{Wheelshafts}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{picture_wheelshaft}

\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

The wheel shafts provide the mounting point for the wheels. This is done by means of a bolt circle on a flange to ensure easy mounting and, if necessary, changing of the wheels. In this shaft, the 200 Nm torque (pink) applied to the keyway is transmitted to the wheel over the entire surface of the flange. The centrifugal force (blue) is also generated again due to the 3000 rpm and this shaft is also mounted on bearings (orange) within the knuckles. You can find out more about this bearing in the suspension section. However, this shaft must be able to withstand the mass inertia of the wheel (red). This is calculated by
\(5/2 \times m_{\text{wheel}} \times a\)

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{picture_forces_wheelshaft}
\caption{Forces acting on the wheelshaft}
\label{fig:wheelshaft_forces}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Wheels}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{spaceholder_technical_drawing}
\caption{}
\label{}
\end{figure}

Finally, we transfer the torque (pink) to the wheels via the contact surface of the flange (green). The mass inertia of the wheel (red)
\(5/2 \times m_{\text{wheel}} \times a\)
, again the centrifugal force at 3000 rpm (blue) and the local pod weight of approximately 600 N (orange) also have an effect here. This weight, together with the rolling friction coefficient of the rubber cover, enables slip-free propulsion. We get this coefficient of 0,5099 by the formula
\[
\frac{m \cdot a}{m \cdot g}
\]

Our motor is mounted in the chassis using a bracket. This contains all the holes for screws and other components that protrude to the rear. End plates with screw holes are welded to four arms to finally screw () them into the chassis. The torque () and the inertia of the motor () prevail at this bracket.

To finally support this first area of the drive system, we also support the shaft that protrudes from the motor. This is done using the CHDF35 flangebearing from Misumi. This bearing is finally integrated into the chassis by another bracket. Only the weight of the motor shaft (), its mass inertia and the wheight of the flangebearing () act on this bracket.

To provide sufficient support for the drive axle, we mount it at two points. For space reasons, we designed the bearinghouse ourselves. The weight of the axle (pink) acts on this bearinghouse at the respective point, as well as its mass moment of inertia (). This bearing shell is installed with screws (green) on another bracket in the chassis.

As already mentioned, the bearinghouses are mounted on additional brackets. Like the motor brackets, these brackets consist of a plate with screw holes () to which end plates are welded via which the component is installed in the chassis (). The same forces act on this bracket as on the bearinghouse with the weight of the bearinghouse itself ().
