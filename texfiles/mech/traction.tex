\chapter{Traction System}

\section{Introduction}
The traction system of the Fermion efficiently transmits the power from the batteries to the motor to the ground, facilitating the acceleration, and maintaining high-speed stability. This system is intricately designed to optimize the pod's grip and minimize slippage, particularly during high-speed operations and in varying track conditions. 

Key considerations for the traction system include the selection of materials and technologies that maximize frictional force while minimizing wear and energy loss. Additionally, the system must be robust enough to handle the dynamic loads and stresses encountered during rapid acceleration, sustained high-speed travel, and deceleration phases. 

In this section, we will delve into the specifics of the traction system, exploring its components, design considerations, and the integration with the overall pod architecture. The focus will be on ensuring that the system contributes to the overall efficiency, safety, and performance of the Hyperloop pod, aligning with the project's goals of high-speed and sustainable transportation.
