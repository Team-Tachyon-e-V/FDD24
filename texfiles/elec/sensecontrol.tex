\subsection{Control Boards/Units in the Vehicle}
% Insert content from the first snippet related to Control Boards/Units in the Vehicle here.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Brakes Controller
    Lacking. To be added.

    \item Thermal Controller
The Thermal Management Controller is responsible for cooling the Traction Components, i.e., Motor and Traction Controller. The actuator is the coolant pump which is controlled  with the feedback of the temperature of coolant in the cooling loop.  The Pump Speed is controlled via PWM to the MOSFET Bridge. The PWM duty cycle is simply calculated from a lookup table that is referenced to the temperature difference between target and actual temperatures. The only safety feature to be developed is to issue an emergency stop signal to HV Systems in the event the coolant temperature exceeds a critical
temperature.
