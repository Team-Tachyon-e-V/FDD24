\subsection{Overview}

Our S\&C subsystem consists of a 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Control Boards: \begin{itemize}
            \item Braking Controller
            \item Thermal (Cooling) Controller
    \end{itemize}

    \item Telemetry Device: \begin{itemize}
            \item CAN Bus
            \item Telemetry Transceiver
            \item Network Transceiver
            \item GUI/Logging system
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
In this section, the main components of the sensor network and software architecture shall be described, as well as their basic functionality. A special focus shall be made on how safety mechanisms are implemented in these systems. Extensive design descriptions are expected for, if applicable:

\subsection{Control Boards}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Brief overview of all control boards (Brakes, Thermal)
    \item Diagram with the connection of all boards with NAP and control station.
    \item Brief description of communication protocols used.
\end{enumerate}
