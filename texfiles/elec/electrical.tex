\subsection{(b) List of all discrete electrical subsystems.}
We are implementing the following subsystems: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item LV Battery
    \item HV Battery System, including \begin{itemize}
        \item Battery Management System
        \item Insulation Monitoring Device
    \end{itemize}
    \item Traction Inverter
    \item Propulsion Motor    
    \item Sense and Control System
\end{itemize}

\subsection{(a) Brief overview with the main points of the HV and LV systems.}
Our electrical system provides the electrical power for the propulsion and control systems. We have a low voltage circuit nominally rated at 24V (for control systems) and a high voltage level circuit at 444V (for the traction system).
The low voltage circuit activates and controls the high voltage power supply through the Battery Management System and is hence designed for reliability. \\
The high voltage circuit is designed for safety, being potentially lethal, and power, in order to maximize the use of the motor. An OEM Insulation Monitoring Device checks for the (lack of) resistance between chassis and the HV power line in case of short circuits. \\
The traction inverter uses the electric power of
the high voltage battery to power the motor, 
converting DC power into AC phases. We use an 
OEM device that is used in automotive purposes. 
\\
\par The motor is a lightweight motor from Emrax. Even though it belongs to the traction system,
we will document it in the electrical section, 
as the development team of the originally
planned inhouse-built inverter took over the 
duty of the electrical part of the
motor system, too.
\par The Sense and Control System is not part of the EHW definition of the electrical systems. Since we have to provide a documentation nonetheless and the team designing the electrical subsystem also designed the Sense and Control system, we decided to include it as a part of the electrical subsystem documentation. It controls the brakes, the thermal pump, the telemetry line and the telemetry unit, as well as additional physical sensors. 

\par Our general design of this season is inspired by conventional modes of transportation,
as we have not had the capacity to start developing a levitation system by this season
Thus, we focussed on an electrical system that drives our friction-based motor with
excelling acceleration, which is a problem that railway systems frequently face.

\par In between design and production phase, we received a sponsorship of Leadrive,
a local startup for research on automotive power electronics.
Furthermore, the institute for electrical systems (ISEA) of our home university offered us assistance in the production of battery cells.
Therefore, our workload was eased, which turned out to be favorable
because of our lack of team members in the electrical field. This has been a crucial
constraint in the design and planning process of the electrical department
since the last season. Only shortly before submitting the ITD, we were able to make an estimation of
realistic goals for the new team.

\par This year, we would like to set the path for magnetic levitation in the future, relying on an active system
inside the vehicles. This was taken into consideration when designing the power dimensions,
keeping plenty of overhead for the future, which aligns with our goal of sustainability.
By having reusable modules, the design process of the upcoming years will be simplified.

\par We collaborate with the following institutions for support in the electrical department (including S\&C):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Altium:} Sponsored Licenses of PCB design software
    \item \textbf{Festo:} Sponsored mechanical components and sensors for pneumatic systems.
    \item \textbf{Mouser Electronics:} Sponsored certain electronics.
    \item \textbf{WÃ¼rth Elektronik:} Sponsored certain electronics.
    \item \textbf{Leadrive:} Sponsored traction inverter
    \item \textbf{Vector Informatik:} Sponsored CANoe Suite, including technical training for CAN networks.
    \item \textbf{Bender:} Sponsored Insulation Monitoring Device.
    \item \textbf{ISEA:} Assembling our battery pack.
\end{itemize}
